## Thoughts

I decided to update the graphs today and found many little troublesome spots.  For instance, I don't calculate the domain automatically which means the graphs only show the bounded domains from the first graphs I displayed.  

Another thing is that the data files were all over the place, wonky and crazy.  Sync'ing these up is important if you're going ot keep a viz up to date.

Finally, I noticed that I have a lot of utility functions which aren't used.
