# Notes for 10 July 2017

- Removed a minor linting error

## To Do

 [ ] Need a line graph so we can compare more than 2-3 sets of data in one graph
 [ ] In the line graph, I want some interactivity
 [ ] More unit tests
 [ ] Figure out better ways to modularize code to enable better unit tests
 [ ] Look into better js linting settings
