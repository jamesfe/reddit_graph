## Interactive vizualization

- Got a prototype up and running of the interactive viz
- Still need to add reddit name somewhere on the graphic
- Seems fast, but I need to test on a slower machine maybe
- Not happy about setTimeout hack, no great solution in sight
- Need to filter down to top 20 reddits
- Need to go back and get list of political reddits for `reddit_stats`
- Maybe do some more styling
- Need unit tests
- Need to refactor
