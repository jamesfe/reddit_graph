# Notes on JS Visualizations

I am learning a lot about javascript lately, to include:
 - Webpack
 - Babel
 - Transpilation (babel)
 - Setting up a JS project from scratch
 - The Browser (and not much more than Chrome, sadly)

I am also learning about how to organize my JS code and when to pass what around.  Maybe I will make a config object that I can pass to each handler.
