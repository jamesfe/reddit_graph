## Interactive Viz

OK so the interactive visualization is pretty much a finished product.  I'm going to decrease the dataset to 20 reddits and publish a blocks.

Today I also added the text to the mouseover handler.  This was cool only because it went so quickly.  It's a tribute to the fact that if you practice something, you will get better and faster at doing it.  That's cool, and I am seeing the dividends right now.

I need to add some unit tests, maybe some styling, but soon this portion of the project will be over.

## TO DO

- [ ] Unit Tests
- [ ] Make a smaller JSON
- [ ] Refactor again if possible?
- [ ] Remove references to specific selectors
