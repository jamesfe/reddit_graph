# 30 July Notes

## Lessons

- Testing has caught several quirky little errors
- Mocha and istanbul work well together: https://istanbul.js.org/docs/tutorials/mocha/
- The old line graph was ugly and is gone
- My code is becoming a little repetitive so maybe I should branch out to new concepts or do some extreme refactoring
- Code coverage is good but I may want to refactor out even more functions that don't deal with "display" so we can better know what to test
