# reddit_graph

A bunch of hacked together d3 scripts to visualize some of the data from my [reddit_stats](https://github.com/jamesfe/reddit_stats) program.

# Running Things

```
npm install
npm run webpack
# In a separate terminal:
npm start
# now visit http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/
```

I need to fix the webpack compilation/watching/server thing but haven't gotten to it yet.
